      <div class="flexContainer backFade" style="width:65%; text-align: center;">
        CyberSomm comes from a passion for the art of pairing food with wine. It was founded in the Seattle area by a team of passionate sommeliers to bring the joys of a perfect pairing into your home. We also hope to possibly enlighten you to something that you may have never tried before because there is no feeling comparable to the wonderment of new discovery. From the team at CyberSomm, we hope you love what you drink!
