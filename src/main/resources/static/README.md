# CyberSomm
## Virtual Sommelier Assistant

This is the website portal for the CyberSomm application. It demonstrates mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the purpose of developing a web app that will assist in the selection of wines to pair with food.

### Additional
The site is constructed to run inside a SpringBoot application. The contact.html page utilizes some "thymeleaf" functionality to assist with the handling of the GET and POST requests to send the information as an email through the Java backend.
